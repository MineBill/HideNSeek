This is an editor plugin for the [Flax Game Engine](https://flaxengine.com) that allows you to lock/unlock actors.

## Usage
Right-clicking on an actor in the scene tree will show one additional option for locking the actor if it's unlocked or unlocking if it's locked.

![Unlocked](.github/images/unlock_actor.png)

When selecting multiple actors, two options will be show, "Force Locked" and "Force Unlocked". These options do exactly that.
